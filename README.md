# Intro

Hi everyone! I personally prefer not to use ROS in my systems, because what is life without a little risk and throwing your compute out the window because the documentation for what you need is non-existent.
This implementation is fully in C++ and CMake.

# Requirements

First of all, you have to follow the steps from the Cartographer documentation to intall it (without ROS): https://google-cartographer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html
